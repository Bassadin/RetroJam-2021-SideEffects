General:
- Objects of high complexity (Fences, Balls, etc) should be created only as a plane with a prerendered texture that depicts the object
- N64 texture cache is 4Kb, so keep them low res
- Effects like smoke etc should be a texture on a plane

Props/NPC:
- NPCs facial features can mostly be texture
- Max amount Faces: 900-1000 per model
- Model must not be detailed
- Textures can be drawn in Blender
- Textures can be a plain color or drawn with some details but not realistic
- If possible: Only one texture file per model
- Max texture size: 512x512
- Animations possible via skeleton animation

Map:
- Max amount Faces: 4000, but not that important
- Textures can be drawn or realistic but extremely zoomed in/low res
- Max texture size: ?
- If possible: use multiple textures 
- Mostly used texture size: 32x32
