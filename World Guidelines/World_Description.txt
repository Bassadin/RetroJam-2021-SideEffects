Worldbuilding:
who is the player:
Wannabe Mercenary, that works for a Corporation as a pilot for a research team, that examines
materials from foreign planets. In 22XX working in a corporation is highly dangerous, as wars often
break out in between them, meaning all ships should be capable of space warfare. During his first
fight he crashed the ship on an alien planet and is left somewhat traumatized
TL:DR:
- Badass armor
- Not so badass person
- Imagine Samus or Master Chief without nerves of steel
- Uses Laser Pistol
Where are we:
Alien Planet
MC crashlanded on MW-537 after a Dogfight with a space fighter belonging to an opposing
corporation. Its planet surface is mostly uncharted but it turns out, its rich in minerals. Its
atmosphere is constantly clouded, causing the whole planet to have lower light levels. The ground
consists mostly of darker stone, like basalt, Slate or shale, but also some Granite and Limestone.
Grasslike plants cant grow, only trees are strong enough, most have a grey, purple-ish or burgundy
and maroon.
Basic architecture can also be found.
TL;DR:
- niedrige lichtverhältnisse
- grauer Himmel
- Gestein: Basalt, Schiefer, Granit und Kalkgestein
- Vegetation: Bäume in grau, violet-isch, weinrot und kastanienbraun.
- einfache gebäude
- sowohl aus beton, mechanischem zeugs (Türen aus metall zb.) und organischem (chitin-Schielde
als dekor, Alien „Schlafzimmer“ aus dunklem Wachs)
Why are we here:
just to suffer?
What is the player trying to do:
Repair ship and flee alien planet
Trying to survive, the MC has to fight of the enemy forces and protect their crew from being killed.
As long as they can gather enough ore or even better raw metals, the onboard repair system can
mend damage done to the ship. Fuel won‘t be as easy though, a proper alternative has to be found.
why are we attacked:
space racism
who is attacking us:
xenophobic natives of the planet
not much more advanced than 2080 humanity but with much extremer views on outsiders, these
humanoid creatures are ferocious in purging the MC‘s crew from their planet. Negotiations fall flat.
Their physique can easiest be described as distorted humans with an exoskeleton. Their appendages
are much thinner and longer, though their lower legs look like a goats hindlegs. On the head the
exoskeleton merges with their face, which bares resemblance to a chimpanzees skull.
Their weaponry is still based on projectiles, unlike humans who have mastered energy arms. But
their weapons are inspired by dalek tech.
TL;DR:
- Exoskeleton
- face looks like chimpanzee skull
- humans but long
- goat legs
- dalek weapons
- physical projectiles
